      <description>Using the data from Standord Educationa Data Archive (SEDA), we can descriptively show the mathematics achievement outcomes of the US counties and how they compare among each other.
Each county is given an estimate of the average grade level of mathematics performance pooled across all students from grade 3 to 8 and from the years of 2009 to 2016. Since only students from grade 3 to 8 are included in the data, the estiamtes are scaled so that achievement on average is 5.</description>
