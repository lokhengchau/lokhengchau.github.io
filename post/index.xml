      <description>Using the data from SEDA, we can descriptively show the mathematics achievement outcomes of the US counties and how they compare among each other.
Without too much technical details, each county is given an estimate of the average grade level of mathematics performance pooled across all students from grade 3 to 8 and from the years of 2009 to 2016. The estimates from all counties are then compared to see which were performing above or below average.</description>
